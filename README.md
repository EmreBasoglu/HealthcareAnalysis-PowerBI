# Health Care Analysis
Welcome to the project repository for healthcare analysis! In order to find patterns and insights in patient demographics and healthcare expenses, this project will use Power BI to analyze a healthcare dataset.

medical condition: Medical condition of the patients

# Analysis Steps
Data Understanding: Examining the dataset to understand its structure and content

Data Preparation: Cleaning the data and preprocessing it to ensure it is ready for analysis

Visualization: Creating visualizations that highlight key findings in the data

Reporting: Interpreting analysis results and deriving actionable insights that can help with healthcare decision making

# Disease Analysis Report:

1. If we look at the cost of illness, Cancer is the most costly disease with approximately 43 million. It is followed by Asthma, Hypertension, Diabetes, Obesity and finally Arthritis, the least costly disease.

2. If we look at the total number of patients in the dataset; 1708 patients with asthma, 1703 with cancer, 1688 with hypertension, 1650 with Arthritis, 1628 with obesity, 1623 with diabetes.

3.Individuals with AB- blood type are more prone to suffering; notably, those with AB- blood type are predisposed to obesity.

4. The majority of patients' test results indicate abnormalities

# Patient Analysis Report:
1. The percentage of women getting sick is 49.25% and men getting sick is 50.75%. Almost equal numbers of women and men get sick.

2. The cake is almost equally divided among insurance providers, but the insurance company that is ahead is Cigna with 20.4%.

3. It is seen that patients mostly apply to hospitals in very urgent cases. This number is almost 90%

4. Penicillin, lipitor, ibuprofen, aspirin, paracetamol are the drugs recommended to patients and the most recommended is penicillin.
